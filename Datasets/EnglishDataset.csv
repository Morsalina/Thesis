And all the fans out there of Brazil and Argentina and the others good luck 
Will be rooting for them again in 2022 and till death
Oh one thing I forgot to mention, I saw Germany win the WC when I was alive, at least I will be there to tell the glory of 2014 and the bitter truth of 2018
How many do really get the chance to see the team they're supporting win the cup
I did! And still proud of that, no matter the shits you say, you can't take away our glory of winning those 4 cups
I'll be there watching it all just let me be at my own for today
ADIOS for now

It is well known that students of IUT have to complete their undergraduate(Consisting of 180+ credits) within 3 years and 10 months.

But still, with the amount of academic pressure, current students are doing really good in competitive programming.

Other than senior programmers like M Saiful Bari and Mohammad Abdullah Matin Khan, juniors are also doing really good.

4th semester student, Shadman Protik was part of the runner up team in the last national programming contest held in Daffodil International University. He also has 1750+ rating point in Codeforces.

Another student from 4th semester, Zubayet Zaman Zico has solved 300+ problems in Lightoj very recently as well as solved around 1500+ programming problems in different online judges. He is 3rd among Bangladeshis in Project Eular Contest at HackerRank as well as has around 1750 rating point in Codeforces.

4th semester student Bakhtiar Hasan is ranked no.1 in Bangladesh in Project Eular Contest at HackerRank.

Another student from 4th semester Mahfuz Alam has solved 200+ problems in lightoj. He is also ranked no.4 among Bangladeshis in Project Eular Contest at HackerRank.

It is also great to inform that even first year students are doing very good. Fahim Shahriar Shakkhor from first year has solved more than 1000 problems in online judges along with having 1800+ rating point in Codeforces. Some other students from 1st year are also doing very good.

Not only that students from CSE Department are doing good in Programming, even students from other departments are also doing programming. Rashed Abid from 6th semester (EEE) has already solved near 1000 problems in different online judges.

We expect that junior students will take part more in competitive programming and achieve much more glory for IUT.",49.0,1.9,2.8,9.0,en

316,439,439,"Let us apply this theory of probability to the
Qur‚Äôan, and assume that a person has guessed
all the information that is mentioned in the
Qur‚Äôan which was unknown at that time. Let us
discuss the probability of all the guesses being
simultaneously correct.
At the time when the Qur‚Äôan was revealed,
people thought the world was flat, there are
several other options for the shape of the earth.
It could be triangular, it could be quadrangular,
pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, octagonal,
spherical, etc. Lets assume there are about 30
different options for the shape of the earth. The
Qur‚Äôan rightly says it is spherical, if it was a
guess the chances of the guess being correct is
1/30.
The light of the moon can be its own light or a
reflected light. The Qur‚Äôan rightly says it is a
reflected light. If it is a guess, the chances that
it will be correct is 1/2 and the probability that
both the guesses i.e the earth is spherical and
the light of the moon is reflected light is 1/30 x
1/2 = 1/60.
Further, the Qur‚Äôan also mentions every living
thing is made of water. Every living thing can
be made up of either wood, stone, copper,
aluminum, steel, silver, gold, oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrogen, oil, water, cement, concrete, etc. The
options are say about 10,000. The Qur‚Äôan
rightly says that everything is made up of
water. If it is a guess, the chances that it will
be correct is 1/10,000 and the probability of all
the three guesses i.e. the earth is spherical,
light of moon is reflected light and everything is
created from water being correct is 1/30 x 1/2
x 1/10,000 = 1/60,000 which is equal to
about .0017%.
The Qur‚Äôan speaks about hundreds of things
that were not known to men at the time of its
revelation. Only in three options the result
is .0017%. I leave it upto you, to work out the
probability if all the hundreds of the unknown
facts were guesses, the chances of all of them
being correct guesses simultaneously and there
being not a single wrong guess. It is beyond
human capacity to make all correct guesses
without a single mistake, which itself is
sufficient to prove to a logical person that the
origin of the Qur‚Äôan is Divine.--Dr.Zakir Naik

Volume 1, Book 3, Number 56:

Narrated Abu Huraira:

While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came and asked him, When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place? Allah's Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some of them said that Alllah's Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet finished his speech, he said, Where is the questioner, who enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)? The Bedouin said, I am here, O Allah's Apostle. Then the Prophet said, When honesty is lost, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday). The Bedouin said, How will that be lost? The Prophet said, When the power or authority comes in the hands of unfit persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)

We need you. Help us to arise a new morning

I'm a student of the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. The whole country's students want quota reformation in the government job sector of Bangladesh. They were doing peaceful demonstrations from yesterday but was attacked by the police force for nothing. Even girls' dormitories aren't off the limits anymore. The government seems to have taken control over the national media, most of which is conveying misleading and often times biased news. So we need help from the foreign media. Please come forward - the situation is beyond control.

We need you to inform the world of what is happening.

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin.
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world.
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority
Defiant often flyin' off at the handle at my mom, no dad.
So I am noncompliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trying to diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive
Talking to myself, either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed
Cause I'm crying and sobbin'

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people‚Äôs blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You‚Äôve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I‚Äôm young
You might say I‚Äôm unlearned
But there‚Äôs one thing I know
Though I‚Äôm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I‚Äôll watch while you‚Äôre lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I‚Äôll stand over your grave
'Til I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôre dead

This is a plea for help.

On 29th of July 2018 school going students were killed by a reckless bus driver. The students protested with slogans on the same bus stand.

Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.

Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.

But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 4th August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.

4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped. And the Government is sitting there silent.

WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE.

Notes: # I took help from many of my seniors,juniors and friends who previously scored well and I was under direct supervision of one of my senior brothers from cadet college, took feedback from them and tried to improve my weak points.
           # In case of vocabularies focus more on topic related words than so called unique or uncommon or tougher words and be sure of the collocations. Check the spelling mistakes. Be careful in using linking words, use them but not in excess and unnecessarily. 
          # Use relevant examples!!! 
          # Use more complex sentences with some simple and compound sentences and make sure your grammar is alright. 
          # Read samples! read samples!! Read samples!!! and practice! 
         # Plan the essay beforehand, take minimum 5-7 minutes to plan and organize your thoughts, note them down! It will save your time! 
         # Revise the whole essay for at least once!

Most of the people are keenly interested to reform quota but the government doesn't want to reform this, already they took control over national media so we need help of foreign media.Please come forward, the situation is beyond control.

I'm a student of Islamic University of Technology ( IUT, a subsidiary organ of OIC ) located in Bangladesh. The whole country's students want Quota reformation of the government jobs sector of Bangladesh.They are doing movements from yesterday and attacked by police force for nothing. Most of the people are keenly interested to reform quota but the government doesn't want to reform this, already they took control over national media so we need help of foreign media.Please come forward, the situation is beyond control.

I'm a student of the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. The whole country's students want quota reformation in the government job sector of Bangladesh. They were doing peaceful demonstrations from yesterday but was attacked by the police force for nothing. Even girls' dormitories aren't off the limits anymore. The government seems to have taken control over the national media, most of which is conveying misleading and often times biased news. So we need help from the foreign media. Please come forward - the situation is beyond control.

We need you to inform the world of what is happening.

2919,4034,4034,"I can tell you exactly what happened here. This happened in a business park located in Rye Canyon in Santa Clarita, California. 

During a car show that Paul was using to support his charity Reach Out Worldwide, Paul and Roger (The Owner) of Always Evolving Performance, where the event was held decided to take a spin.

They left the AEP parking lot turning right onto Alta Vista Ave. They then turned right onto Constellation Rd, and then right again onto Kelly Johnson Pkwy where the driver began testing the limits of the Porsche.

Kelly Johnson Pkwy has a small s curve and a wide sweeping right turn that turns into Hercules St. Paul and Roger's speed was too fast into the curve and the car's rear end kicked out toward the driver side. The driver then over corrected and the passenger side rear end kicked out to the passenger side.

Sliding sideways at high speed, the car hit a light pole directly on the passenger door where Paul was sitting and the car was split/wrapped around the pole. The car then came to a sliding stop on a small tree where it then caught fire.

You can Google ""Hercules St, Valencia California"" and then select street view. You can then follow the path I've described above and see their final path and exactly what I've narrated.

We all know him as ""The king of Pop"", the legendary 
Michael Jackson...

He may have died a long time ago, but his heart still beats among millions of his fans. And that's why people keep saying ""love lives forever.""

I'm a student of Islamic University of Technology ( IUT) , Bangladesh. The whole country's students want Quota reformation of the government jobs sector of Bangladesh.They are doing movements from yesterday and attacked by police force for nothing. Most of the people are keenly interested to reform quota but the government doesn't want to reform this, already they took control over national media so we need help of foreign media.Please come forward, the situation is beyond control.
We need you. Help us to arise a new morning

3228,4508,4508,"Too often we tell ourselves we aren't  smart enough or attractive enough or talented enough to pursue our dreams. We buy into what others say about us, or we put restrictions on ourselves. What's worse is that when you consider yourself unworthy, you are putting limits on how God can work through you!
When you give up on your dreams, you put God in a box. After all, you are His creation. He made you for a purpose. Therefore your life cannot be limited any more than God's love can be contained. I have a choice. You have a choice. We can choose to dwell on disappointments and shortcomings. We can choose to be bitter, angry, or sad. Or when faced with hard times and hurtful people, we can choose to learn from the experience and move forward, taking responsibility for our own happiness. As God's child, you are beautiful and precious, worth more than all the diamonds in the world. You and I are perfectly suited to be who we were meant to be! Even still, it should always be our goal to become an even better person and stretch our boundaries by dreaming big. Adjustments are necessary along the way because life isn't always rosy, but it is always worth living. I'm here to tell you that no matter what your circumstances may be, as long as you are breathing, you have a contribution to make.

This is a plea for help.

On 29th of July 2018 school going students were killed by a reckless bus driver. The students protested with slogans on the same bus stand.

Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.

Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.

But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 2nd August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.

4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped, many more have been injured severly. And the Government is sitting there silent.

WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE.

If no one reads my wall, it will be a short experience, but if you read this message, make a comment with a word about me. Just a word will do... For example, any place that reminds you of me, any object, a moment, a restaurant, coffee, movie etc. Then copy this message on your wall and I will also leave a word that reminds me of you.

I'm a student of the Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. The whole country's students want quota reformation in the government job sector of Bangladesh. They were doing peaceful demonstrations from yesterday but was attacked by the police force for nothing. Even girls' dormitories aren't off the limits anymore. The government seems to have taken control over the national media, most of which is conveying misleading and often times biased news. So we need help from the foreign media. Please come forward - the situation is beyond control.

We need you to inform the world of what is happening.

To one of the few women who made me the kickass sonuvagun I am today,
To the powerhouse that never seems to tire,
To the amazing chef always welcoming me with food fit for gods,
To the one who built me to be the emotional rock that I am by virtue of her tough love principles,
To the patient (read: usually impatient) and incredibly tolerant woman dealing with my crap for the entirety of my time here,
To the woman responsible for my time here,
To the amazing person who is all of the above,
To the glue keeping the family tight,
To Ammu,

You are more of a gift to me than you think I am to you. Always and forever. In case I don't say it enough, you're the best mother one can ask for. I wish I could be your idea of perfect, and I try my best, but to err is human. One day, In Sha Allah, you will have all you want of me. And that'll be the pinnacle of success for me.

You can't be outdone, outshone.

Always look up to you regardless of how tall I grow. 

Love you more than I show.

Happy Mother's Day, Ammu. Tomake cchaara jibon bhaaba jay na.

Dear Abbu,

I realised recently that I managed to grow taller than you. That's a childhood mission completed, really. And I know that you'll probably not grow much anymore. But that's okay. I'll always look up to you regardless.

Thanks for dealing with my bullshit. I swear I don't do it on purpose. 

Much love.

4799,7172,7172,"Dear parents of children applying to universities here particularly ones that test you on the HSC syllabus, this is just a gentle reminder.

It is NOT OKAY to belittle your children because they couldn't get in to a presumably excellent institution for their undergrad. Especially if they, like myself, are coming from an entirely different academic background. It is NOT OKAY to tell your children that they are useless if they couldn't get in while a few of their friends could. 

Let us consider a simple example. Suppose you're an ENT specialist. And now you're given 3 months to learn about the heart entirely and enough to be able to successfully perform an open-heart surgery, whilst in a flight above Ukraine with guns on the ground ready to fire at you. You may be able to pull it off, but if you aren't, can you really be blamed? 

Don't blame us for not surviving a war that we weren't taught to fight to begin with. Some of us get lucky. Some of us don't. But we all try. At least the few I've talked to, who are in the same crap as myself. With all due respect, appreciate our efforts as much as you ask us to appreciate yours.

The country plunges further into darkness each day. What saddens me is that 90% students taking board exams expect getting questions beforehand. Why?
If you are taking an exam why would you expect a question leak? Why would you search for it, buy it, spread it, even look at it? Our education system is possibly the worst one, but why do you have to be dishonest, corrupt? 
Your parents, your teachers, shaped you into the person you are today, they tried to teach you all the best values and ideals there can be. How can you stain their names for a few marks? What remains the difference between an uneducated person and you if you can't stand up against those very people when they force you to cheat?
Why should all the lessons, all the education of 10 or 12 years go in vain? ""‡¶∏‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶§‡ßã ‡¶®‡ßá‡ßü"" can never be an excuse, you should do as your conscience says, if you have any.
Allah is watching, and you will surely face judgement at His will. Even if you are an atheist, karma is a bitch. üòÇ
You may joke about it like ""‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶®‡¶ü‡¶æ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶∏ ‡¶π‡¶á‡¶§"" but let this be the end of that.
You will feel severe crisis of self-respect someday. 
What is the point of getting 90 being corrupt? I would be happy scoring 70-80 of my own accord. Even asking your friends for answers is wrong, but nothing compares to the question issue.
Things that are wrong can never get you success, don't sell yourself out. Stick to your ideals, stick to what is right, you will surely get its reward.

We need to understand that getting 90+ is not worth selling out our values. If our parents and teachers force us to get good marks even if we don't deserve that, we need to correct them, not indulge in corruption. Marks won't even get us jobs, if we don't have skills. And if we want to be businessmen, artists, musicians, or anything else, we don't need good marks. For once we need to follow the path we dream of, with dignity.

Ah, 2017 - the sequel to 2016 that nobody asked for. The first half went by pretty smoothly, but the second half was pretty rough, and culminated in one of the worst things I've ever experienced. However, I was determined not to let it change me, and December 2017 was arguably one of the best months in my life, thanks to some very special people whom I will be grateful to forever.

This was the year I reconnected with old friends, made new ones, lost some, and found out which ones really matter. This was also the year where I somehow made a comeback academically despite all the shit I had going on.

I don't really believe in resolutions but if I had to have one, it'd be to go into 2018 with a more positive outlook on life. Do I have regrets? Of course I do - I mean, who doesn't? But, they're a part of what makes me who I am today, and if I could do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a plea for help.

On 29th of July 2018 school going students were killed by a reckless bus driver. The students protested with slogans on the same bus stand.

Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.

Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.

But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 2nd August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.

4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped, many more have been injured severly. And the Government is sitting there silent.

WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE.

Regarding the matter of posts disappearing from people's timelines and people noticing unusual activities in their facebook accounts, including logins from unidentified devices as suggested in the photo attached:

A Facebook account normally is attached to a cell phone number and government has access to all telecom number in Bangladesh. Now Government Intelligence agency (DGFI and NSI) can access all the telecom and they are using masking technology to access the phone's text message. By using the option of ""Forget My Password"" -> Send a Text to Reset Password -> They are changing password getting into account and deleting stuff. Later they keeping all active session on so that facebook user can log into his/her account without using password as they don't want to get caught by facebook.

How to fix this problem:

1. Take off your phone number from facebook. (Settings>Mobile>Remove)
2. Use only Gmail or Hotmail email address in recovery option.
3. Download Google Voice app on your cell phone and Create a new virtual number and then use it as a recovery option. Bangladesh Government has no access to Google data.
4. At the end Change your password and logout from all active session. (Settings>Security and Login>Change Password>Log out of all sessions)

Make sure you take off your cell phone number from your email address as well. Two-step verification is not safe for Bangladesh.

Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.

Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.

But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 4th August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.

4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped. And the Government is sitting there silent.

I'm a student of Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh. The whole country's students want Quota reformation of the government jobs sector of Bangladesh.They are doing movements from yesterday and attacked by police force for nothing. Most of the people are keenly interested to reform quota but the government doesn't want to reform this, already they took control over national media so we need help of foreign media.Please come forward, the situation is beyond control.
We need you. Help us to arise a new morning

This is a plea for help.
On 29th of July 2018 school going students were killed by a reckless bus driver. The students protested with slogans on the same bus stand.
Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.
Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.
But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 2nd August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.
4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped, many more have been injured severly. And the Government is sitting there silent.
WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE.

I'm a student of Islamic University of Technology ( IUT) , Bangladesh. The whole country's students want Quota reformation of the government jobs sector of Bangladesh.They are doing movements from yesterday and attacked by police force for nothing. Most of the people are keenly interested to reform quota but the government doesn't want to reform this, already they took control over national media so we need help of foreign media.Please come forward, the situation is beyond control.
We need you. Help us to arise a new morning

This is a plea for help.
On 29th of July 2018 school going students were killed by a reckless bus driver. The students protested with slogans on the same bus stand.
Since then All students of Bangladesh are protesting for safer roads and more strict regulations.
Their intention was never to harm even a single person. Neither it is now.
But today POLICE AND PEOPLE OF CHATRO LEAGUE tortured students with tear shell, they beat students brutally and raped the female students (on 2nd August 2018). The students are trying to defend themselves with sticks and tree branches that they've found on the streets.
4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped, many more have been injured severly. And the Government is sitting there silent.
WE NEED YOUR HELP. PLEASE.

We rode through the night On green, marbled Water, and, half-waking, watched The white, eroded peaks of icebergs Sail past our windows; Rode out the night in that north country, And awoke, the house buried in snow, Perched on a Chill promontory, a Giant's tooth In the mouth of the cold valley, Its white tongue looped frozen around us, The trunks of tall birches Revealing the rib cage of a whale Stranded by a still stream; And saw, through the motionless baleen of their branches, As if through time, Light that shone On a landscape of ivory, A harbor of bone.

The thing I witnessed that broke my heart was the way we are destroying Bay of Bengal. Today was the only day I felt ashamed of being a Bangladeshi. The number of chips' packs, cold drink cans and plastic cups that were thrown into the sea was probably uncountable, not to mention the number of times I have seen people spit into the sea. None of us can change things on our own. Lets start from our families. Lets keep the beautiful things beautiful. Lets not ruin nature anymore.

On July 26,2015 I attended my first class at the college. And now I'm here standing in my college campus and wondering how time flew away. Leaving Chittagong and coming to Dhaka for studying was one of the saddest things for me at that time. I never thought of getting such mentors, teachers, friends and most of all memories out of my college life back then. This was probably two of my best years in this small life I have already lived. 
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me the opportunity to see a leader like Tameem Ahmed Chowdhury sir. I will always remember this man for making the college a whole lot better and enjoyable place for us the Adamjeeans. 
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me teachers like Zakia Sultana ma'am to whom I can look upto for every problem I face. 
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me the opportunity to spend times with so many wonderful people whom I call my ""FRIENDS"". 
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me some awesome seniors who will always be ready to help their juniors with whatever they can.
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me so many memories that I will cherish throughout my life.
Adamjee Cantonment College gave me a family which people know as a club. Adamjee Cantonment College Photography Club - ACCPC is my family <3 I will miss working. 
Last but not least Adamjee Cantonment College gave me a motto to follow and make world a better place. I pray and intend to build my life based on the motto ""EDUCATION DISCIPLINE MORALITY"".
