# Thesis

The increased use of social media platform usage such as Facebook has given an
opportunity to express one’s thoughts and ideas to everyone. Social media posts can
be used as a medium for determining different psychological traits, such as dark triad
characteristics. In our thesis, we used peoples’ social media posts, and using those
posts we tried to detect presence of dark triad traits based on the hand crafted features
extracted from their posts. We also have shown, the usage of code mixing as a
effective feature. We have used traditional machine learning models, ensemble
models as well as transformer based language models to find the best possible
outcome. For finding linguistic features analysis we have used Polarity of text,
subjectivity, lexical_density, word_tokens, word_count, avg_word_length,
word_freq_dist, stopword_count, part_of_speech, Topic segmentation and many
more. We then compared the performance of all the models. For all the traits,
ensemble of 4 traditional machine learning models outperformed all other models.
The highest accuracy achieved in narcissist detection was 96.36% , for Machiavelli it
was 98.27%, and for psychopathy it was 99.62%.
